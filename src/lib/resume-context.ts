## Origin Story
After his Bachelor's in Business Administration, Lukas founded Brasiventures,a CBD brand. Packaging, Shopify store, distribution to Berlin kiosks,all built solo. Learned what it means to take a product from zero to market. Every decision, every mistake, every win was on him.
Then landed at Gorillas in the middle of hypergrowth. As Expansion Manager, responsible for building permits and fire safety across nearly 100 locations with a €2M+ budget. Turned Excel chaos into an Airtable dashboard that put Ops and Legal on the same data foundation. Grew into a role that didn't exist before,a problem nobody wanted to touch.
In renewable energy came the defining lesson. Built the right system,but nobody used it. The boss didn't understand it, so the team ignored it. Realized: digitalization in Germany doesn't fail because of technology. It fails because of culture. Knowledge silos, dependency on individuals, fear of change. The GPT workshops he ran afterward worked,because they met people where they were. Showed people what AI could do for them directly, within their daily tasks. Moved on from that chapter quickly.
The digitalization wasteland in the German Mittelstand shaped him,and still keeps him up at night. That's why he wants to do it better, not just complain. Completed courses in Business Information Systems to qualify for the Master's, now at Uni Potsdam with focus on AI and digital transformation. Today works with a biotech founder on everything his company needs. Builds own products to understand what's possible with the tools he recommends to others.
Core belief: It's about more than efficiency. Companies suffocate under their own structures. Knowledge disappears inside individual heads instead of living in the system. Changing that,enabling companies, not just advising them,that's what drives him.

## Case Studies

### 1. From Excel Chaos to Live Dashboard – Gorillas / Getir
Context: Gorillas was in the middle of hypergrowth. New locations opened faster than operations could keep up. Every location required change-of-use permits, fire safety approvals, and regulatory inspections. As Expansion Manager, grew into a role nobody had systematically addressed before.
Problem: Nearly 100 locations, each with its own permit status. Everything ran on Excel. Legal and Ops worked with different versions, documents got lost, deadlines were missed. Stores on the verge of closure – not because business was bad, but because paperwork was missing.
Solution: Built an Airtable dashboard centralizing the entire permit process. Every location, every document, every status – in one place. Legal could access all documents in real time, Ops had visibility on upcoming deadlines. Became the internal reference on German building regulations and fire safety codes.
Result: Stores stayed open. P&L directly protected. Miscommunication between Legal and Ops eliminated. A system that didn't exist before became the backbone of expansion.

### 2. From Deep Expertise to Investor-Visible – GRÜNZUCKER GmbH
Context: Biotech startup converting biomass into sugar. Founder had years of technical expertise but not a single document that would explain to an investor why it matters.
Problem: No website. No working pitch deck. No fundraising strategy. No validated market model. The company was invisible to investors – not because the technology was bad, but because it wasn't compellingly presented anywhere.
Solution: Built the website. Structured the pitch deck from scratch – market problem as entry point, not technology as hero. Calculated and validated TAM/SAM/SOM model. Stress-tested financial projections. Developed investor relations strategy. Not a consultant mandate – sits at the table and builds alongside.
Result: Company now investor-visible. Professional web presence, fundraising narrative in place, pipeline of partnerships including Fraunhofer Institute.

### 3. From Zero to Own Brand – Brasiventures
Context: Early 20s, no team, no budget, no network. Built a CBD brand and sold it in Berlin as a full-time business.
Problem: Nothing existed. No product, no shop, no distribution, no brand. Everything had to be built by one person. CBD was a difficult market: regulatory gray area, shunned by banks, restricted by platforms.
Solution: Everything. Packaging design, Shopify store, retail distribution strategy. Personally went to Berlin kiosks and corner shops. Every sales conversation, negotiation, return, and decision. B2C and B2B in parallel as a one-man operation.
Result: Six-figure revenue over three years. The real value was the learning: how to bring a product to market, negotiate without a company name, manage sales, operations, and finances simultaneously. "My MBA on the street."

### 4. Why the Tool Doesn't Matter – Renewable Energy Company (BEC-Energie)
Context: Mid-sized renewable energy company. 18 employees. Projects ran on Excel, email, and individual knowledge. Ten-year veterans were irreplaceable – not because they were better, but because only they knew where things stood.
Problem: Classic information asymmetry. No central system, no transparent project status, no documented processes. Every handover was a risk. Every vacation a bottleneck.
Solution: Designed a relational Airtable database as a central project OS. Technically clean, but leadership didn't adopt it – so nobody did. Pivoted to GPT workshops that met people where they were. That landed because it was direct and personal.
Result: Technology without buy-in is shelfware. The bottleneck is never the tool, but whether people are ready to work differently. This experience shapes every engagement today.

### 5. AI Workshops in the Mittelstand
Context: After the failed Airtable implementation, it was clear: introducing tools doesn't work if people don't experience the value themselves.
Problem: Employees had heard of ChatGPT but had no idea what it concretely means for their daily work. Mix of skepticism, overwhelm, and "that's not for us."
Solution: Hands-on workshops working directly on real tasks from participants' daily work. Drafting emails, summarizing reports, preparing data, accelerating research. Everyone worked with their own use case, not abstract examples.
Result: Workshops worked where the Airtable project failed. People felt the value immediately on their own work. Several employees continued using the tools independently afterward.

### 6. Real Estate Calculation Tool (In Progress)
Context: Most people calculate real estate investments in overly complex Excel sheets or not at all.
Problem: No accessible tool displaying essential metrics of a real estate investment quickly and understandably.
Solution: Custom calculation tool covering purchase price, ancillary costs, financing structure, rental income, ongoing costs, cash flow projection. Focus on clarity – input in minutes, result immediately visible.
Result: In progress.
